# Lion
Lion is an easy-to-use pc software manager for windows users. It helps you manage software on your computer.
It helps your download software easier.

**STOP DEVELOPMENT: Choose [WingetUI](https://github.com/marticliment/WingetUI)! It just works!**

First of all, I would like to say great thank you to all the project below! Without you, the lion software
manager is impossible to achieve! Thank you!

 - [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli)
 - [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs)

Lion helps you manage software easier. The target of Lion is to create a  pc software manager just like 
[360 Safe](https://soft.360.cn/) or [Tencent PC Manager](https://pc.qq.com/). If you prefer better 
user experience, it's recommanded to use them! They are pretty useful if you have already install them!
